# 0x02 Python - import & modules

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers topics of importing modules using python

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* How to import functions from another file
* How to use imported functions
* How to create a module
* How to use the built-in function dir()
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs
